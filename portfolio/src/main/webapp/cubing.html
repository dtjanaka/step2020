      <p class="text-block">
        I first learned to solve the Rubik's Cube in 7th grade with the help of
        online tutorials. Since then, I have spent thousands of hours solving
        the Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles. Cubing has allowed me to have
        fun, compete, and meet awesome new people. In high school, I started a
        Cubing Club which continues to thrive and grow. In college, I likewise
        joined the school's Cubing Club. I have attended three cubing
        competitions, each of which was a blast. Over time, I have gotten my
        times for the Rubik's Cube consistently below 20 seconds. I use the
        Oretega method for 2x2, CFOP for 3x3 (full PLL), and the Yau method for
        4x4. My personal bests for several puzzles are shown below.
