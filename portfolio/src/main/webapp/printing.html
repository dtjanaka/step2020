      <h1>3D Printing</h1>
      <p class="text-block">
        I first became interested in 3D printing through cubing when I became
        interested in making my own twisty puzzles. With the help of online
        tutorials, I learned how to CAD in Solidworks. In high school, with
        access to the school Makerspace's printers, I was able to bring my
        designs to life. Since then, I have gotten my own 3D printer at home and
        use it for everything from robotics and micromouse to replacement parts
        and keychains. 3D printing has allowed me to rapidly iterate small parts
        for many projects and served as a great outlet for my creativity.

        Currently, I mainly design with Autodesk Inventor although I have also
        have experience with Solidworks and Fusion 360. I have a Tiertime UP
        Mini 2 printer at home.
