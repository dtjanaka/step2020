      <p>
        Micromouse is an event where small robot mice solve a 16Ã—16 maze. I
        first heard about it in high school, but only started in college after
        joining the UCLA IEEE club. Micromice autonomously navigate from the
        start of the maze to the center using sensors to map out walls and
        paths. Common sensors used on Micromice include encoders for measuring
        wheel movements, IRs for detecting walls, and gyroscopes for measuring
        rotations. Additionally, advanced mice incorporate mechanisms such as
        suction fans for greater normal force and maximum potential
        acceleration.

        I have built two mice so far. The first one, a "rat," is a proven design
        provided by the Micromouse instructors in UCLA IEEE which allowed new
        Micromousers such as myself to learn the fundamentals. It is based off
        an ST Nucleo F411-RE development board and has a full sensor setup
        including four IRs and two encoders.

        The second mosue I have worked on is a custom design using the
        STM32F405RGT6 chip. It was designed with Autodesk Eagle; programming is
        done in the STM32 CubeIDE environment. It has six IRs, two encoders, and
        a gyroscope. By adding two more IRs pointing diagonally, the mouse can
        detect openings in walls in advance.
